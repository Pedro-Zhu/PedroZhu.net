							<h1 class="major">2021 Greater London Homicide Data Exploration (WIP)</h1>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/homicide-detective.jpg" width="410" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This is my first personal project. <br>
								I got the idea for the project because I came across the <b>Metropolitan Police Service Homicide dashboard data</b>, which recorded all homicides that took place in Greater London from March 2003 until March 2022. When I saw it, I also remembered that the <b>UK Census</b> took place in 2021 and if I mix the 2 of them, I could have somewhat accurate data that shows how likely it is for you to encounter a murderer in Greater London. <br>
								I imported the Excel tables into SQL Server, then I did some queries to look around at what I had, and did some cleaning since the homicide data has recordings starting from 2003, and I only wanted the ones in 2021, after that, I connected the 2 tables through the borough name. To finish it, I imported it all into Tableau, made graphs and a map showing the number of murderers, and, in the end, put it all together into a dashboard.</p>

<!-- 							<h2>Preparing the data</h2>
							<p>The <b>UK Census</b> had information from England and Whales, so I had to extract the data that was relevant to Greater London.
